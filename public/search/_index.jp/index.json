[{"categories":["\\[directadmin\\]"],"content":"DKIM is a means of authentication using cryptographic techniques designed to combat email spoofing. A DKIM-enabled mail server will generate a hash of the email contents that it wants to sign, use its private key to encrypt it, and sign the outbound message with it. Remote servers receiving email from the DKIM-enabled mail server will check that signature against DNS records added to the sending domain’s DNS zone and verify the signature. They do this by retrieving the public key from the domain’s DNS, using it to decrypt the encrypted hash, and then generating their own hash for comparison against the original hash to determine if they are equal (DKIM passes) or not (DKIM fails).\nDirectAdmin gives the server administrator many options to enable DKIM in order to fit their needs, whether they want it enabled globally by default, on a per-domain basis, on a per-user basis, or just provide the option for users to enable it at will.\nImportant Considerations\nWhen enabling DKIM, it is important to understand that the DKIM DNS record is created and added to the local zone files. Thus, if any domains are using eternal DNS, you must copy these records over to the remote DNS zone file for those domains. Once configured on the local mail server for a domain, outgoing messages will be signed, so you’ll want to make sure that a public key exists in any remote zone files for a domain using remote DNS.\nEnabling the Ability For the Users To Choose Whether To Enable DKIM\nTo allow the users to choose whether or not to enable DKIM, you must set dkim to the value of 2 in the directadmin.conf and the rewrite Exim’s configuration files and recompile Exim for this. Log into the server via SSH as the root user and issue the following command to do this,\n/usr/local/directadmin/directadmin set dkim 2 restart cd /usr/local/directadmin/custombuild ./build update ./build exim ./build eximconf Now, a user can enable DKIM with a click of a button in the DirectAdmin interface via User Level → E-Mail Accounts → Enable DKIM. dkim directadmin\nEnabling DKIM Globablly By Default For All (Future and/or Existing Domains)\nFor Future Domains\nIf you’d prefer to have a DKIM record created by default upon domain creation, you would need to set to the dkim option in the directadmin.conf to a value of 1. To do this, run the following commands via SSH as the root user,\n/usr/local/directadmin/directadmin set dkim 1 restart cd /usr/local/directadmin/custombuild ./build update ./build exim ./build eximconf Now, all future domains will have a DKIM record created by default. For Existing Domains\nEnabling automatic DKIM record creation doesn’t affect existing domains, though. You have a few options for adding DKIM to the old domains once you’ve enabled dkim in the directadmin.conf. You can either do this for each domain one-by-one or for all existing domains at once.\nTo enable DKIM for all existing domains after setting dkim to 1 in the directadmin.conf, you can run the following command via SSH as the root user,\necho \u0026ldquo;action=rewrite\u0026amp;value=dkim\u0026rdquo; \u0026raquo; /usr/local/directadmin/data/task.queue; /usr/local/directadmin/dataskq\nTo enable DKIM for only select domains one-by-one, use either the task queue or dkim_create.sh script provided by DirectAdmin (replace DOMAIN.COM with the domain you’d like DKIM enabled for),\ncd /usr/local/directadmin/scripts/dkim_create.sh DOMAIN.COM Or echo \u0026#34;action=rewrite\u0026amp;value=dkim\u0026amp;domain=DOMAIN.COM\u0026amp;dns=yes\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /usr/local/directadmin/data/task.queue; /usr/local/directadmin/dataskq Note: that both commands work the same way with the exception that you can have the DKIM written immediately with the dataskq verses within one minute with the dkim_create.sh script. Disabling DKIM on a Per User Basis When Enabled or Permitted Globally\nThis feature is designed so that DKIM is either enabled or permitted globally, but you can disable it on a per user basis. This requires either dkim=1 or dkim=2 set in the directadmin.conf. The setting of 1 will enable DKIM automatically for all domains under each user unless you specify otherwise in their user.conf files. The setting of 2 will allow them the ability to enable DKIM themselves unless otherwise specified in their user.conf file.\nNote that setting dkim=0 in the directadmin.conf fully disables DKIM for the entire server and the user.conf files won’t be checked. Thus, if you want DKIM disabled globally by default with the option to enable for certain users/domains only, setting dkim=2 in the directadmin.conf is a better option.\nWhen you create a user, you will have created them with a default domain. This domain will have DKIM created for the domain by default due to the globally enabled setting and the non-existence of a user.conf until after the account is created (no user.conf to edit and disable dkim). So, the DKIM for the default domain will need to be removed manually if you’d prefer it not have a DKIM record. Here are the steps to first remove the record for the default domain and then disable the automatic DKIM record creation for subsequent domains under that user.\nTo remove the records from the default domain, remove the x._domainkey TXT record from /var/named/DOMAIN.TLD.db and then remove the keys,\nrm /etc/virtual/DOMAIN.COM/dkim.public.key\nrm /etc/virtual/DOMAIN.COM/dkim.private.key\nNow, edit the user.conf so that no subsequent domains created under the user have DKIM records enabled by setting dkim=0. The user.conf can be edited via SSH as the root user and the file is located here (where USERNAME represents the username of the user you are editing),\n/usr/local/directadmin/data/users/USERNAME/user.conf\nThis allows that particular user’s dkim setting to override the globally enabled dkim setting set in the directadmin.conf and thus prevents any DKIM records from being created for that user’s domains moving forward.\nRestart DirectAdmin after making the changes,\nservice directadmin restart\nDisabling DKIM on a Per Domain Basis\nThis is essentially the same feature as the per user feature, with the exception that you would edit the domain’s configuration file located in /usr/local/directadmin/data/users/USERNAME/domains/DOMAIN.TLD.conf, instead. You do not need to edit the user’s user.conf file for per domain control.\nIf a certain domain uses both a remote DNS and a remote mail server, you may want to disable DKIM for this one domain rather than all domains belonging to the user. This is where this feature is handy.\nRestart DirectAdmin after making changes to the DOMAIN.TLD.conf file,\nservice directadmin restart\nChanging the Default Selector\nDirectAdmin uses x as the default selector. To change the selector, you will need to update the directadmin.conf with the desired selector. The following examples change the selector to default,\n/usr/local/directadmin/directadmin set dkim_selector default restart\nCustomBuild 2.0 rev 1824 will automatically swap the selector in the /etc/exim.dkim.conf. You will need to rebuild the Exim configuration like so,\n/usr/local/directadmin/custombuild/build exim_conf\nConfirm the selector was swapped in the /etc/exim.dkim.conf file,\n[root@host ~]# grep -i selector /etc/exim.dkim.conf\ndkim_selector = default\nNow, any newly created DKIM records will use your specified selector. Do note that you will need to remove and recreate the old DKIM records that use the old selector if you want them to use the new selector.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/2024-08-27-enabling-dkim-with-directadmin/","tags":"\\[directadmin,linux\\]","title":"Enabling DKIM with DirectAdmin"},{"categories":["\\[directadmin\\]"],"content":"Adding a DMARC record\nDMARC is a system that adds some rules for DKIM and SPF to give remote servers a better idea of what your intention is for messages that fail those 2 systems. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t really do anything other than clarifying the desired actions to be taken by remote servers, but should lower your spam score in some cases. Be sure that your SPF TXT value contains \u0026ldquo;-all\u0026rdquo; (not ~all) and that you have DKIM setup before proceeding.\nTo add a DMARC record when using the Evolution skin:\nNavigate to \u0026ldquo;DNS Management\u0026rdquo;\nClick \u0026ldquo;Add Record\u0026rdquo;\nFor \u0026ldquo;Record Type\u0026rdquo;, select \u0026ldquo;TXT\u0026rdquo;\nTXT Record Type, select \u0026ldquo;DMARC\u0026rdquo;\nEnter your email into the \u0026ldquo;Aggregate Email (RUA)\u0026rdquo; field: spam-reports@domain.com Click \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo;\nFor other skins, like the \u0026ldquo;Enhanced\u0026rdquo; skin, to add a DMARC record, go to your domain\u0026rsquo;s DNS Management interface and add the following TXT record:\n_dmarc TXT \u0026#34;v=DMARC1; p=none; sp=none; rua=mailto:spam-reports@domain.com\u0026#34; Be sure to include the whole thing in \u0026#34;quotes\u0026#34;. The email address spam-reports@domain.com will sometimes be sent reported spam messages by larger providers. Not all services will email this address, but it\u0026rsquo;s handy if a client using a large email provider clicks \u0026ldquo;this is spam\u0026rdquo; for a given message because you\u0026rsquo;ll then be sent that message. Upon receipt, you can determine if someone at your domain is spamming or spoofing, or if the recipient incorrectly labeled the message as spam (at which point, you\u0026rsquo;d probably want to remove that recipient from your mail-out since they likely don\u0026rsquo;t want it).\nThe rua=mailto:email portion is not mandatory if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to get these emails.\nYou can change the values as desired, as per the DMARC specifications.\nGoogle\u0026rsquo;s DMARC guide can also be useful for constructing your DMARC record.\nHow to automate adding a new DMARC for new domains\nIf you like the above setup, and you want to automate its addition to all new DNS zones, you can run the following:\ncd /usr/local/directadmin/data/templates/custom cp ../dns_txt.conf . and then add the record you want to the bottom of the custom/dns_txt.conf by running this command: echo \u0026lsquo;_dmarc=\u0026ldquo;v=DMARC1; p=none; sp=none; rua=mailto:spam-reports@|DOMAIN|\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026raquo; dns_txt.conf\nKeep in mind that this assumes that you have a \u0026lsquo;spam-reports\u0026rsquo; email account created already.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/2024-08-27-enabling-dmarc-on-directadmin/","tags":"\\[directadmin,linux\\]","title":"Enabling DMarc on Directadmin"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/2024-08-23-how-to-block-access-to-xmlrpc-php-serverwide-on-directadmin/","tags":null,"title":"How to block access to xmlrpc.php serverwide on Directadmin?"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/2024-08-23-horemove-this-server-is-running-directadmin-legacy-codebase/","tags":null,"title":"Remove This server is running DirectAdmin legacy codebase"},{"categories":"\\[Linux, RaspberryPi\\]","content":"From: https://gist.github.com/jauderho/6b7d42030e264a135450ecc0ba521bd8 WARNING: READ CAREFULLY BEFORE ATTEMPTING\nOfficially, this is not recommended.
